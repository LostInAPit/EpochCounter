# EpochCounter
A counter to count the days since a specific date using an Arduino nano, DS3231 RTC and a 4-digit 7 Segment display

I designed this project to be a simple, self contained display for your workspace, office or anywhere with access to wall power. The main use of the project is to count the days since a specific event, lifestyle change such as sobriety, mental health goals or really any other reason.
